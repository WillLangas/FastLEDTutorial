# My Project

Using a strip of 300 LEDs, I built a custom light strip for my room. It uses the same code seen elsewhere in this repository,
and I added a few cool color palettes to it based on my preferences.

It requires an arduino, two switch circuits for cycling colors, and the strips themselves. Please contact me if you would
like my schematics and design log, however it isn't a very complicated project. 

Should take anywhere from an hour to three hours depending on the path you take for the project. Leaving the controls on a breadboard
will save you a lot of time, condensing the circuit and soldering will add about an hour, and depending on your preferences, programming
can take a while.
